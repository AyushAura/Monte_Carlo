# Monte_Carlo
Developed Python simulation employing Monte Carlo algorithm 
# Polymer Unfolding Simulation using Monte Carlo & Metropolis Algorithm

This project simulates the unfolding of a polymer chain under different residue interaction settings using:
- Monte Carlo algorithm
- Metropolis acceptance criterion
- Energy thresholds for unfolding

## Features
- Interaction energy range: -0.25 to -2.50
- Measured unfolding time (in steps)
- Comparison between native and interacting residues
- Free energy profile plotted with respect to reaction coordinate

## Output
- Free energy profile (saved as `free_energy_profile.png`)
- Stats printed to terminal

## Dependencies
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
